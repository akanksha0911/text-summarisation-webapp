Description: It intends to provide concise, accurate, easy to read, and comprehensive summaries of lengthy audio files or text files that one can read within a few minutes.

Reading a condensed summary of details from a long audio file/text file can give anyone a sense of what file focuses on or help catch up on hours’ worth of content in minutes.

In the case of online content available today, it is massive. Books, articles, blogs, and audios like podcasts, broadcasting of news on radio channels, speeches, etc. All the audio files data obtained from these sources are not effectively a valuable means of gathering information every time. It is always effective if the data is obtained from the condensed content i.e. focusing more on essential points than the entire content.
This application can be intensively used in summarizing business meetings. It serves in more efficient progress tracking in project meetings and facilitation of learning using online courses. As a voice-to-text application, people with hearing disabilities could benefit from summarization to keep up with content in a more productive way.

An audio or text file will be taken as input to progress with this application, and data summarization processes will be implemented to get condensed text output.

# Getting Started with text-summarisation-webapp 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
